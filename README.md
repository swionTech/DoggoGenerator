<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<span>Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span>

<p>This was a fun little project I wanted to do, mainly because I am a big dog person!  I started with a more basic plain colored background, and then updated the look of it using a photo with a gradient overlay.</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements:</h2>
<p>There are some improvements still needing to be made with the responsive design.  The transparent banner behind the h1 needs to be fixed to format correctly on a smaller veiwport size, along with the text alignment of the dog info.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>I spent some time fighting with the background, both the original and photo, as it kept not fitting just right.  I finally fixed the issue by setting a min-height as 100% in the CSS.</p>
